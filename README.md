# PyDAQ 
General purpuse data aquisition program

Features:
- GPIB Device scanning
- Tested with Yokogawa (WT230,WT130) and HP/Agilent (34980A, E1326) devices. 
- Eurotherm PID comminication 
- Multiple plots and dynamic variable plotting
- Signal curve configurations

This program also send commands to arduino when a certain temperature setpoints is reached, but since it was used for prototyping purposes the reference temperature channels need to be changed in the code, there is no input on the interfce for this.
